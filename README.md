# My Personal Portfolio

## Design Goals
- This was my first hosted portfolio and as such I wanted to make sure the styling was unique. I wanted to make sure it stood out from other portfolios I had seen -- so after having read CSS In Depth I decided to do somewhat of a skeumorphism theme.

## Future Goals
- It will undergo a refactor eventually (with Svelte), I would like to overhaul the design/styling as well. It's currently functional enough to showcases projects but is quite poor in terms of styling organisation.
